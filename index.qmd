- **Comprehensive**: Covers fundamental to advanced topics
- **Biology-focused**: Examples and applications relevant to biological data
- **Beginner-friendly**: Written for university year 2 students with basic programming knowledge

## 📖 Book Structure

### Part I: Fundamentals

Build your foundation in deep learning with comprehensive theory and implementation:

**Chapter 1: Neural Networks Basics** - Learn about perceptrons, activation functions, forward and backward propagation, and train your first neural network.

**Chapter 2: Convolutional Neural Networks** - Understand convolutions, CNN architectures, and how they process spatial data.

**Chapter 3: Transformers** - Explore attention mechanisms, self-attention, and the revolutionary transformer architecture.

**Chapter 4: Vision Transformers** - Discover how transformers are applied to computer vision tasks.

### Part II: Applied Examples

Put theory into practice with complete biological applications:

**Chapter 5: CNN for DNA Sequence Classification** - Identify promoter regions in DNA sequences using convolutional networks.

**Chapter 6: RNN/LSTM for Protein Sequence Analysis** - Classify protein families using recurrent neural networks.

**Chapter 7: Autoencoder for Gene Expression Analysis** - Perform dimensionality reduction on gene expression data.

**Chapter 8: Transfer Learning with Cell Images** - Fine-tune pre-trained models for cell image classification.
